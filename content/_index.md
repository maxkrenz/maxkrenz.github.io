      text: "I am a M.A. Political Science Student with a strong focus on empirical methods and quantitative analysis. My academic trajectory includes a study term abroad at the University of Antwerp and coursework centered on comparative politics, research design, and applied regression. Alongside my studies, I work as a tutor in empirical social research at Humboldt University of Berlin. My research interests span political economy, public policy, and political behavior, with a particular focus on using large-scale survey data and reproducible workflows in R and Stata to study attitudes, institutions, and policy outcomes."
